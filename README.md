# BrowserNotes

#### Video Demo:

#### Description:

Store notes in the context of urls. This helps organize notes that pertain to specific web pages. Do you have a recipe bookmarked that you make slightly different than instructed? Save it as a note. Leave notes to help you remember why you bookmarked something. Do not save passwords or any sensitive information on notes. They are not a secure storage solution.

## Potential improvements

- Badge indicator for extension icon
- Ability to position notes in separate window (more like a sticky note)
- Ability to tag notes
- Ability to export all note data
